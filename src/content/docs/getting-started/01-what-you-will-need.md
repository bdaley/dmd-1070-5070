## A Text Editor[](about:blank#a-text-editor)

The editor that you use for this course is completely up to you. Your workflow is _your_ workflow. However, I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in my demos and walkthroughs. As such, I will be making use of certain plugins that may or may not exist in your chosen code editor. If you choose to use an editor other than Visual Studio Code, it will be up to you to figure out how to meet the assignment requirements in your editor.

### Here's a list of popular editors:[](about:blank#heres-a-list-of-popular-editors)

*   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended)
*   [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
*   [Atom](https://atom.io/)
*   [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
*   [Others...](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+editors)

## An FTP Client[](about:blank#an-ftp-client)

FTP clients allow us to transfer files from our personal computers to other computers across the internet. FTP is like an [OG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG) Dropbox or Google Drive, except it doesn't sync your files automatically. You must explicitly choose what and when files are transferred.

We'll talk about FTP a little more in an upcoming lesson. But if you're not familiar with FTP, I would recommend downloading and installing FileZilla.

*   [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/) (recommended)
    

**Be sure you download the "Client" version**. The "Server" version would allow other people to transfer their files to _your_ _computer_.

## A Web Browser[](about:blank#a-web-browser)

All of my grading will be done in Google Chrome (hint, hint). Many of my demos will utilize Chrome Developer Tools. I would suggest that you do all of _your_ testing and development in Chrome as well.

With that being said, if you prefer to test your web pages in a different web browser, that is fine. All _modern_ web browsers can handle the work we will do in this course.

Speaking of **modern** web browsers...

**Please do not code your web pages in Safari**. You wouldn't try to watch the latest Avengers movie on your grandparents black and white TV set, would you? We don't view or build web pages in Safari for the same reasons.

## A Wireframing Tool[](about:blank#a-wireframing-tool)

This will make more sense once we cover the web design process. However, you'll need a tool to create low-fidelity wireframes of your web pages. Think of wireframes as blueprints for your web pages. No colors or fancy graphics. Just lines and boxes.

If you're not sure what to use, I would recommend wireframe.cc:

*   [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) (recommended)
*   [Others...](https://www.google.com/search?q=wireframing+tools)
    

**You are NOT required to purchase the premium version**. Every wireframing requirement in this course can be achieved using the free version.

## An Image Editing Tool[](about:blank#an-image-editing-tool)

In this course we will utilize Adobe Photoshop CC. However, if you're more comfortable with an alternative image editing tool, you are more than welcome to use it.

*   [Adobe Photoshop CC](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (recommended)
*   [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)
    

## A Design Tool[](about:blank#a-design-tool)

You might be wondering, "Isn't Photoshop a design tool?" Yes. Yes, it is. And you're more than welcome to us it as such. However, Photoshop was never really made for creating web designs and layouts. It can certainly do the job, but Adobe XD is a much more capable. In my opinion, XD also has a much more gradual learning curve than Photoshop.

*   [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) (recommended)
